This project is part of my dissertation at the Helmut Schmidt University and has been developed over the course of the last years. There are still several open issues but the core ideas of the PhD-thesis could be implemented and verified. One of the upcoming tasks will be to improve the project's organization and add explanations so that the code is usable by others.
